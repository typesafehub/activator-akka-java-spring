  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This tutorial aims to show you how to inject resources into Akka actors
    using Spring. You will be guided through the different parts used to
    integrate Akka with Spring and also create a test wrapper for a service
    and rewire the service used during testing without any code changes needed
    to the actor or the application classes.
  </p>

  <h2> Application Overview</h2>

  <p>The application basically consist of a single actor defined in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/CountingActor.java" class="shortcut">
    CountingActor.java</a>
    file. This actor uses a service defined in the <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/CountingService.java"
    class="shortcut">CountingService.java</a> file to increment a
    value. The <code>CountingService</code> is wired into the Actor via Spring.
  </p>

  <p>To drive the actor, there is a application defined in the 
    <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/Main.java" class="shortcut">
    Main.java</a> file in the <code>main</code> method, that does the
    following:
    <ul>
      <li>Initializes Spring</li>
      <li>Creates an actor system</li>
      <li>Creates a <code>CountingActor</code></li>
      <li>Sends a couple of messages to the actor so that it uses the
        <code>CountingService</code></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Running the Application</h2>

  <p>The result of running the <code>Main</code> application is shown in the
    <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab. On the left-hand side we can
    see the console output, which is "Got back 3" for the
    <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/Main.java" class="shortcut"> Main.java
    </a> application.
  </p>

  <h2> Running the Test</h2>

  <p>There is also a Junit test for the <code>CountingActor</code> located in
    the <a href="#code/src/test/java/sample/SpringTest.java" class="shortcut">
    SpringTest.java</a> file. It is structured in the same way as
    the <code>Main</code> application.
  </p>

  <p>The result of running the <code>SpringTest</code> test is shown in the
    <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab. On the left-hand side we can
    see the console output, which is "passed sample.SpringTest.testSpring".
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Akka Extension</h2>

  <p>To be able to use the Spring application context to let Spring create and 
    wire up our actors, we need to store it away in a place that is easily
    accessible from within the actor system. This is an ideal use case for what
    is called an <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/java/extending-akka.html">
    Akka Extension</a>. An extension can be thought of as a per actor system
    singleton and the one in this tutorial is defined in the <a
    href="#code/src/main/java/sample/SpringExtension.java" class="shortcut">
    SpringExtension.java</a> file.
  </p>

  <p>The extension consist of two parts. The <code>SpringExtension</code> class
    that defines the methods used by Akka to create the extension for an actor
    system, and the <code>SpringExt</code> class that defines the methods and
    fields available on the extension.
  </p>

  <p>On this extension, the <code>SpringExt</code> class, there are only two
    methods, <code>initialize(ApplicationContext applicationContext)</code>
    that is used during startup to initialize the extension with the right
    Spring application context, and <code>props(String actorBeanName)</code>
    that constructs a <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/java/untyped-actors.html#Props">
    Props</a> from an actor bean name, that is used to create an actor.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>Props</code> creation uses the <code>SpringActorProducer</code>
    that we will talk about next.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Spring Actor Producer</h2>

  <p>To let Spring create the actor from a bean name we need a way to allow the
    Akka <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/java/untyped-actors.html#Props">
    Props</a> to delegate actor creation to Spring. This is done in the <a
    href="#code/src/main/java/sample/SpringActorProducer.java" class="shortcut">
    SpringActorProducer.java</a> file.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>SpringActorProducer</code> implements the <a
    href="http://doc.akka.io/japi/akka/2.2.0/akka/actor/IndirectActorProducer.html">
    <code>IndirectActorProducer</code></a> interface which is a way to let the
    actor be <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/java/untyped-actors.html#Creating_Actors_with_Factory_Methods">
    created via a factory method</a>. This interface has two methods that need
    to be implemented, <code>actorClass</code> that will return the type of the
    actor that will be created, and <code>produce</code>, that needs to create
    a new actor instance every time that it is called.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Spring Application Configuration</h2>

  <p>To tie everything together and let the Akka actor system know about the
    Spring application context, we have a Spring configuration defined in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/AppConfiguration.java" class="shortcut">
    AppConfiguration.java</a> file.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>AppConfiguration</code> has a single method <code>actorSystem
    </code> that is responsible for creating the ActorSystem singleton in this
    Spring application. The code creates the actor system and then initializes
    the <code>SpringExtension</code> with the Spring application context needed
    by the <code>SpringActorProducer</code> to create actor instances from bean
    names.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Creating a Test Counting Service</h2>

  <p>Since we want to be able to test our actor thoroughly, let's create a test
    counting service. In our tutorial it will just wrap the real counting
    service and do some extra book keeping, but it could just as easily be a
    complete mock of the service.
  </p>

  <p>Open the empty <a href="#code/src/test/java/sample/TestCountingService.java" class="shortcut">
    TestCountingService.java</a> file, and add the code below.
    <strong>Remember to save the file afterwards.</strong>
<pre><code>package sample;

import javax.inject.Named;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

/**
 * A test counting service that wraps the normal counting service
 * and keeps track of the number of times that it has been called.
 */
@Named("TestCountingService")
public class TestCountingService extends CountingService {

  private AtomicInteger called = new AtomicInteger(0);

  @Override
  public int increment(int count) {
    called.incrementAndGet();
    return super.increment(count);
  }

  /**
   * How many times we have called this service.
   */
  public int getNumberOfCalls() {
      return called.get();
  }
}</code></pre>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>A Closer Look at the Test Counting Service</h2>

  <p>Lets take a closer look at the newly created test counting service in the
    file <a href="#code/src/test/java/sample/TestCountingService.java" class="shortcut">
    TestCountingService.java</a>
  </p>

  <p>The class <code>TestCountingService</code> inherits from <code>
    CountingService</code> and overrides the method <code>increment</code> on
    line 16. In that method it keeps track of how many times it has been
    called, by using an internal counter named <code>called</code> and then it
    delegates to the real counting service by calling <code>super.increment(count);</code>
  </p>

  <p>It also has a method named <code>getNumberOfCalls</code> on line 24 that
    returns the value of the internal counter <code>called</code> that can be
    used during testing to verify how the service is being used by the actor.
  </p>

  <p>One important thing to note is the annotation on line 10 <code>
    @Named("TestCountingService")</code>. This will allow us to wire together
    the <code>TestCountingService</code> with the <code>CountingActor</code> in
    the test during the next step.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Wire up the Test Counting Service</h2>

  <p>Now that you have created a test counting service it is time to start using
    it in the test.
  </p>

  <p>Open the <a href="#code/src/test/java/sample/SpringTest.java" class="shortcut">
    SpringTest.java</a> file. And between line 24 and 25, right after
    <code>ctx.scan("sample");</code>, add the two lines below. <strong>Remember
    to save the file afterwards.</strong>
<pre><code>// wire up the test service instead of the normal service
ctx.registerAlias("TestCountingService", "CountingService");</code></pre>
  </p>

  <p>This alias will make sure that when we look for a bean named <code>
    CountingService</code> we will instead get the one named <code>
    TestCountingService</code>. Check that the tests are still green on the
    <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab.
  </p>

  <p>We would also like to check that the actor actually called the service the
    right number of times by using the <code>getNumberOfCalls</code> method.
    Add the code below to the <a href="#code/src/test/java/sample/SpringTest.java" class="shortcut">
    SpringTest.java</a> file. on line 46, just above the comment <code>
    // shut down the actor system</code>. <strong>Remember to save the file
    afterwards.</strong>
<pre><code>// check that it called the TestCountingService the right number of times
TestCountingService testService = ctx.getBean(TestCountingService.class);
assertEquals(3, testService.getNumberOfCalls());
</code></pre>
  </p>

  <p> Check that the tests are still green on the
    <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>

  <p>You now have a working sample that uses spring to inject a service or a
    test service into an actor. Feel free to experiment and change the actor
    <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/CountingActor.java" class="shortcut">
    CountingActor.java</a>, service
    <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/CountingService.java" class="shortcut">
    CountingService.java</a>, test service
    <a href="#code/src/test/java/sample/TestCountingService.java" class="shortcut">
    TestCountingService.java</a> and test
    <a href="#code/src/test/java/sample/SpringTest.java" class="shortcut">
    SpringTest.java</a>.
  </p>

  <p>The Akka extension <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/SpringExtension.java" class="shortcut">
    SpringExtension.java</a>, the actor producer <a
    href="#code/src/main/java/sample/SpringActorProducer.java" class="shortcut">
    SpringActorProducer.java</a> and the application configuration
    <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/AppConfiguration.java" class="shortcut">
    AppConfiguration.java</a> can be reused as the basis for your own
    Spring application.</p>
